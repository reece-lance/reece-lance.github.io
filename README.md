# e-Portfolio

**Welcome to my e-Portfolio for the MSc Data Science Programme.**

This portfolio showcases my learning journey, skills development, and professional growth throughout the master's degree in Data Science. It includes detailed reflections, collaborative work, individual projects, and evidence of skills acquired across multiple core modules. The e-portfolio serves as a demonstration of my ability to solve complex data problems, engage in critical analysis, collaborate effectively in virtual environments, and apply machine learning techniques in real-world contexts. 

## Modules Included:

### Deciphering Big Data

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Identify and manage challenges, security issues, risks, and opportunities in data wrangling.
- Critically analyse data wrangling problems to determine appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques, including data preparation, cleaning, exploration, optimisation, and evaluation.
- Design, develop, and evaluate solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems using relevant programming paradigms.
- Develop and implement the skills required to be an effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

**Key Portfolio Artefacts:**
- **Collaborative Discussion Forum Summaries:** Reflective summaries of discussions covering challenges in data wrangling, analysis of methodologies, and tools used for big data.
- **Outcomes from Team Exercises:** Descriptions of team exercises, including my role and contributions in developing solutions for data wrangling and programming tasks.
- **Individual e-Portfolio Pieces:** Individual tasks showcasing my proficiency in data management, problem-solving, and solution development using big data technologies.
- **Professional Development:** A summary of learning outcomes, team meeting notes, feedback from peers and tutors, and a Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan (PDP).

**Skills Developed:**
- Critical thinking, problem-solving, ethical awareness, teamwork, time management, communication, digital literacy, and data analysis.

### Machine Learning

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.
- Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.
- Apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty are involved.
- Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be an effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

**Key Portfolio Artefacts:**
- **Collaborative Discussion Forum Summaries:** Summaries of discussions covering legal, ethical, and practical challenges in machine learning.
- **Outcomes from Team Exercises:** Documentation of team activities, including application of machine learning techniques to various problems.
- **Reflective Piece:** A critical reflection that covers all learning outcomes, discussing the challenges faced and the learning achieved.

**Skills Developed:**
- Machine learning application, ethical awareness, teamwork, decision-making, critical reflection, and digital literacy.

### Research Methods and Professional Practice

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.
- Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.
- Evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.
- Produce and evaluate critically the resulting research proposal for the chosen topic.

**Key Portfolio Artefacts:**
- **Collaborative Discussion Forum Summaries:** Two summaries covering professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues in computing.
- **Reflective Piece:** Reflection on the key aims of the module and how the learning outcomes have been met.
- **Professional Development:** Feedback from peers and tutors, Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan (PDP), and statistical analysis activities carried out during the module.

**Skills Developed:**
- Research methods, critical thinking, problem-solving, ethical awareness, communication, and professional practice.
