Hi Dinh, I found your comparison of GDPR and the ICO’s Data Protection Act insightful, especially regarding the risk-based approach to data security. Ben made a great point about the UK’s more specific guidelines for reporting data breaches, which shows how the UK’s Data Protection Act is starting to diverge slightly from the GDPR framework.

It’s also important to consider how this divergence could further change, especially now we are post-Brexit, as the UK starts to adapt its data protection laws to better suit its own national context. While both frameworks still share many core principles, the differences in areas such as breach notification and future regulatory updates might mean that businesses will eventually have to navigate increasingly distinct compliance frameworks. This could complicate matters for organisations that operate in both the UK and the EU, making cross-border compliance more complex over time.
