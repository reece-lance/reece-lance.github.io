Hi Dalbir, I really appreciated your detailed comparison between the GDPR and Norway’s Personal Data Act (PDA). To expand on your points regarding compliance, one key area to consider is the use of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs). Both GDPR and the PDA require DPIAs when processing activities present high risks to individuals' rights and freedoms, such as in cases involving cross-border data transfers or large-scale processing of sensitive data (European Commission, 2023).

Norway’s Data Protection Authority has already imposed significant fines for failures related to DPIAs and risk assessments. For example, Ferde AS was fined NOK 5 million for not conducting a proper risk assessment when transferring personal data outside the EEA (EDPB, 2021). DPIAs are crucial not only for ensuring compliance but also for demonstrating accountability and transparency, two principles fundamental to both GDPR and PDA frameworks (GDPR.eu, 2023). By properly incorporating DPIAs into their compliance strategies, organisations can anticipate and mitigate risks more effectively.
