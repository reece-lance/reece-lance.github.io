# Team Exercise: Database Design Project for Transport for London (TfL)

## Overview

This section documents the completed team project where we designed a logical database for Transport for London (TfL). As a team of three, we collaborated to create a database solution to manage TfL's transport data efficiently. This project covered aspects such as logical database design, data management pipeline, and the evaluation of database management systems (DBMS).

### My Role and Contributions

- **Communication and Coordination:** I initiated and maintained clear communication among team members using WhatsApp and forum threads, which ensured consistent updates and collaboration throughout the project.
- **Task Assignment and Planning:** Developed a detailed project plan, dividing tasks based on each member's strengths and availability to optimise workflow and meet deadlines.
- **Data Management Pipeline Development:** Led the design and implementation of the data management pipeline using Python, including data retrieval from TfL's API, data cleaning, and preparation for database loading.
- **Report Compilation and Submission:** Compiled the final report, edited it for coherence and adherence to word count, and managed the final submission process.

### Key Outcomes

- **Effective Collaboration:** The team worked effectively, meeting deadlines despite differing availability and skill levels.
- **Logical Database Design:** Created a logical database design featuring multiple tables that captured key entities (e.g., stations, routes, vehicles) essential for TfL operations.
- **Data Pipeline Implementation:** Successfully implemented a data management pipeline to handle data retrieval, cleaning, and storage efficiently.
- **Learning and Reflections:** Gained valuable experience in database design, data management, and team collaboration in a virtual environment.

### Feedback and Reflection

#### Feedback Received:
- **Strengths:**
  - The report demonstrated good understanding and practical application of module topics.
  - Effective descriptions of data availability, user requirements, and a structured report format.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - More depth was needed in describing the logical design and explaining the data management pipeline.
  - The report should have focused more on the required elements, excluding sections such as the benefits of DBMS selection.

#### Reflection:

The feedback highlighted areas where the report could have been more focused and detailed, particularly in explaining the logical design and data management pipeline. Moving forward, I plan to:

- **Enhance Depth of Analysis**: Study advanced topics in database design and data management to provide more comprehensive insights in future projects.
- **Improve Report Focus**: Ensure future reports strictly adhere to assignment requirements and provide clear, concise discussions without superfluous content.
- **Strengthen Team Dynamics**: Focus on fostering more inclusive team dynamics, balancing leadership roles with opportunities for peer development.

### Conclusion

This project was an essential learning experience in database design and collaborative teamwork, equipping me with valuable skills for future professional roles in data science.
