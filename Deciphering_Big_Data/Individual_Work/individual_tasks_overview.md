# Individual Tasks Overview

This section outlines the individual tasks required for the e-portfolio as part of the "Deciphering Big Data" module. Completed tasks are documented, and placeholders are provided for tasks that are pending completion.

## Completed Tasks

- **Collaborative Discussion 1 - The Data Collection Process (Units 1 - 3):**
  - This task has been completed and is documented in the file `Collaborative_Discussions/discussion_summary.md`.

## Pending Tasks

### Task 1: Data Cleaning (Unit 4)

- **Objective:** Clean datasets retrieved from various sources, including data obtained through API access.
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Retrieve data from the TfL API using Python scripts.
  - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and convert data types as needed using the `pandas` library.
  - Document the approach, challenges, solutions, and reflections upon completion.

### Task 2: Data Cleaning Continued (Unit 5)

- **Objective:** Continue the data cleaning process by addressing more complex data cleaning requirements.
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Detect and correct data anomalies, ensure data consistency, and prepare data for further analysis.
  - Reflect on the techniques used and lessons learned during the process.

### Task 3: Normalisation Task (Unit 7)

- **Objective:** Normalize the cleaned data for efficient storage and querying in a database.
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Apply appropriate normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to organize the data into a structured format.
  - Ensure data integrity and optimize for performance.
  - Document the steps, outcomes, and reflections.

### Task 4: Collaborative Discussion 2 - Comparing Compliance Laws (Units 8 - 10)

- **Objective:** Compare and analyse different data compliance laws and their implications for data professionals.
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Engage in the discussion, provide initial contributions, and respond to peer feedback.
  - Reflect on key insights and learning outcomes upon completion.

### Task 5: API Security Requirements (Unit 10)

- **Objective:** Implement security measures to protect data retrieved via the TfL API, ensuring compliance with best practices.
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Implement HTTPS, OAuth 2.0, and access control mechanisms.
  - Document the approach, any challenges faced, and reflections.
